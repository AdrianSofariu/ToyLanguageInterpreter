# Toy Language Interpreter (Java)

## üöÄ Overview

This project implements a **toy language interpreter** in **Java**, designed to explore the basics of Java programming while building and interpreting a new set of instructions.
The interpreter supports step-by-step execution of programs, displaying all memory structures (heap, stack, etc.) in a **GUI** built using **JavaFX**. 
The toy language also supports files, although at this stage, the language does not have conversion from plain text to instructions. 
Instead, available programs are defined in a list using the toy language constructs.

## üñ•Ô∏è Features

- **Interpreter for Toy Language**: A custom language interpreter that can execute programs written in the toy language.
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: The **JavaFX GUI** allows users to step through each instruction of the program and see the execution process.
- **Memory Visualization**: Memory structures such as **heap** and **stack** are displayed and updated in real-time as the program executes.
- **File Support**: The toy language supports files, though no text-to-instruction conversion is currently implemented.
- **Instruction Set**: The interpreter currently supports a basic set of language constructs for managing variables, control flow, and simple operations.

## üß± Structure
The basic building blocks of the toy language are:
- Expressions
- Statements
- Types
- Values
- TypeChecker
